    <h1> Score Increase, or Money Back Guarantee </h1>
    <p> We start with a baseline score.  It will always be based off of the student’s last official test.  This includes the last time they took the SAT, ACT, or PSAT.  If you feel that the last official score is not a reflection of where your student is currently at, I am willing to come to an agreement on what is a fair baseline score.  For the SAT’s the guaranteed score will be 150 points higher than the baseline score, and for the ACT it will be 3 points higher than the baseline score.  I will send weekly emails with the total amount of hours I have worked with your student, as well as the total amount that I would owe if the student’s goals are not reached.  I will sign a contract stating that if the following scores are not obtained on the next official test, after 15 hours of tutoring is completed, then I will refund all of the money that I have been paid. The contract can be found <a href= "asmith Test Prep Score Guarantee Contract.pdf"> here </a>.  </p>
