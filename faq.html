    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
    <ol>
        <li> <b> We have a number of tutors/companies that we are considering, how we do we find out if we want to work with you without having to spend any money? </b> 
        <br> 
        I am happy to meet with you for a free consultation to analyze any previous tests that your student has taken and to discuss how I can work with your student to help them achieve their goals in order to allow you and your student to decide if I am a good fit to work with them. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li> <b>  What if we think you are a good fit after meeting with you, but after a session or two we decide that we don’t to continue working with you? </b>
        <br>
        If you know longer wish to work with me after four sessions, I will provide a 50% refund.  Four sessions is the optimal time because if a tutor has not helped you at all after four sessions,  they probably will not be able to help you. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li> <b> Test prep tutoring costs a fortune, is there anyway that you can save me money? </b>
        <br> 
        The most cost efficient way to prepare for the SAT’s/ACT’s is by learning in a small group setting (typically 2-4 students, but I do not have a limit to the number of people that are allowed in one session).  This is beneficial because the majority of the session is spent teaching the test, which students don’t have in depth knowledge of prior to tutoring.  The only time that is wasted, is time spent covering content that one student knows that another student does not.  In order to mitigate this problem, I do not recommend that students work together if they are scoring more than 200 points apart on one section. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li> <b> Every service says pretty much same thing, something like “Our students get results because we have the top instructors who help students master content and focus on improving their weaknesses.”  What do you do that’s actually unique? </b>
        <br>
        My focus is centered around saving the client as much as money as possible.  In order to do this, I teach students how to reflect on questions on their own, so they are prepared to improve there score without the support of a tutor after about 15 sessions.
