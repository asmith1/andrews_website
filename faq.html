    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
    <ol>
        <li> <b> We have a number of tutors/companies that we are considering, how we do we find out if we want to work with you without having to spend any money? </b> 
        <br> 
        I am happy to meet with you for a free consultation to analyze any previous tests that your student has taken and to discuss how I can work with your student to help them achieve their goals in order to allow you and your student to decide if I am a good fit to work with them. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li> <b> Ok, so what if we think you're a good fit after meeting with you, but after a session or two we decide that we don’t to continue working with you? </b>
        <br>
        That’s totally fine, you can stop meeting with me at any point that you would like, I do not ask to be paid for sessions in advance. <br>

        <li> <b> I want to improve my child’s SAT/ACT score, but I don’t want to break the bank to do it, what is my best option? </b>
        <br> 
        The most cost efficient way to prepare for the SAT’s/ACT’s is by learning in a small group setting (typically 2-4 students, but I do not have a limit to the number of people that are allowed in one session).  This is beneficial because the majority of the session each session is spent teaching the test, which students don’t have a lot of information on prior to tutoring.  The only time that is wasted is time spent covering content that one student knows that another student does not.  In order to mitigate this problem, I do not recommend that students work together if they are scoring more than 200 points apart on one section. <br>
