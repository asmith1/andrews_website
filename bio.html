	<h1> Biography </h1>
    <h2> Experience </h2>
	<p> I have worked with several educational organizations over the last few years including Mathnasium, NJ Literacy, and my own independent tutoring service.  I most recently worked for an AmeriCorps program called City Year, where I served as a Team Leader and mentored corps members on how to improve the quality of instruction that they provided to students.  I have worked with students from all different ages and demographics in various content areas, but I have recently begun to focus on test prep. </p>
    <h2> Tutoring philosophy </h2>
    <p>  Regardless of the subject or grade level that I am working with, I utilize Socratic questioning, which involves asking students questions that guide them to the answers.  I would not be doing my job as a tutor if I was just giving answers to students, but by utilizing Socratic questioning, I am able to facilitate the student’s thought process to help them think about questions in the ways that make the most sense to them.  In addition, this method allows me to check for their understanding, so I can tailor the session to best fit the individual student’s needs.  </p>
    <p> I also believe the best tutors work themselves out of a job, which is why a major emphasis of my tutoring sessions is placed on teaching students how to reflect on questions themselves.  This not only enhances the student’s understanding of the test, but allows them to improve their score without the support of a tutor.  A student will typically require roughly 15 sessions before they are able to effectively reflect on questions independently, but this number does vary significantly from student to student.  </p>
