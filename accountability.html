    <h1> Accountability </h1>
    <p> I understand that spending money on SAT prep is an investment and that the expectation is that there will be improvement in the student’s scores.  In order to keep the student and parent informed about the student’s progress, I email detailed reports each week, showing student progress in each section, as well as on different types of sessions.  This not only helps the student understand where they are improving and where they still need work, but ensures the parent that their investment yields a satisfactory return.  </p>
