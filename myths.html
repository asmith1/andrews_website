    <h1> Myths </h1>

    <h2> Myth #1 </h2>
    <b> Commercial test prep companies can reliably improve your score at least a hundred points. </b>
    <p> If this was true they would be able to comfortably guarantee a score increase of 100 points.  Companies typically do not allow data on their average score increases to be accessible to the public, but the most recent study done by the National Association for College Admission Counseling found there to be only a 30 point increase across the industry for test prep.  </p>

    <h2> Myth #2 </h2>
    <b> The more hours of tutoring a student gets, the better they will do. </b>
    <p>  For most students, the benefits of tutoring are minimal after the first 15 hours or so, as students who receive 15 hours of tutoring do just as well on average as students who do significantly more.  Commercial test prep companies spend tremendous resources on measuring and minimizing their customer acquisition costs, and as a result want to retain their existing customers for as long as possible, but this does not mean that the student benefits from tutoring for as long as possible. </p>

    <h2> Myth #3 </h2>
    <b> Commercial test prep companies are the safest options. </b>
    <p> Commercial test prep companies are huge gambles that rarely pay dividends.  They require an investment of thousands of dollars with no guarantee of a score increases.  I guarantee a 150 point increase on the SAT, and a 3 point score increase on the ACT, not because I think it is certain to happen, but because I’m not going to take someone’s money if I am not able to help them.  </p>

    <h2> Myth #4 </h2>
    <b> The SAT’s/ACT’s test high level academic material. </b>
    <p> The tests asses very basic academic concepts, as the math section goes up to 9th grade math, the reading level on the passages is 8th-10th grade, and the writing section is basic grammar. They can’t test high level work because every high school has different standards and requirements, can only assess skills that are fundamental to a student’s education.  However, in order to distinguish students, they test these concepts in convoluted ways that are completely different than what a student has seen in school.  This is why it is necessary for the tutor to understand the test, and not just the content on the test. </p>
