    <h1> Approach </h1>
    <p>  I typically spend about 20% of time in tutoring sessions teaching test content, and 80% of time teaching the test, but this does vary depending on the student.  This looks a little bit different for each section, here is how it breaks down. </p>

    <h2> Math </h2>
    <p> There are typically three reasons why a student will get a question wrong on the math section. The first reason is that the student may not have had the math knowledge to correctly answer the question.  This problem is solved by providing the student with problems on a specific topic, for example, solving an equation for x, or finding the area of a circle.  Students are able to improve their scores this way because the SAT’s/ACT’s ask questions on a very narrow set of topics over and over again, so a student can improve their scores by drilling these specific topics. </p>
    <p> Silly mistakes are another reason why students will typically get a question wrong.  The solution to this is not to just tell a student to “be careful” or to “check your work next time.”  The SAT/ACT are time pressured tests, which causes students to be more likely to make silly mistakes.  In addition, the creators of the tests intentionally cause students to make silly mistakes by wording questions in convoluted ways and making the answer choices such that if you will get one of the wrong answers by making a mistake they set students up to make.  I help students solve the problems in the most time efficient way possible, so that they have a moment to check their answer immediately after they answer the question, to make sure they answered what the question asked and did not make any silly mistakes. </p>
    <p> The final reason that students that will get a question wrong in the math section is that they did not understand what the question was asking.  For example, the question may be asking a student to solve a system of equations, but they may ask it in a weird way that the student has never seen before, leaving them confused on what to do.  Although the way the problems are worded is unique to the SAT/ACT, the test asks questions in the same way over and over again.  Therefore, I am able to teach students to decode SAT/ACT questions so they are able to understand what concept the question is testing.  </p>
    
    <h2> Reading </h2>
    <p>  Reading comprehension is a skill that is developed over a students entire academic career, and it is not possible to significantly improve a student’s reading comprehension in only a few months.  Fortunately the SAT’s/ACT’s test a very specific type of reading comprehension, one which involves reading a passage very quickly and answering deceptive multiple choice questions.  I teach students a time efficient process to attack these passages and questions to increase their scores.  Specifically, I have students read the topic sentences of each paragraph the first time through, as opposed to the entire passage, and then have students cross out three wrong answers, as the wrong answers are much easier to identify than the correct answers.  </p>

    <h2> Writing </h2>
    <p> A lot of people wonder how the SAT’s/ACT’s tests a students writing ability on a multiple choice test, and the answer is that they don’t.  The writing section doesn’t test a student’s writing ability, but rather their knowledge of a handful of grammar rules.  Student’s are able to improve their scores faster in this section than the others by mastering the handful of writing rules tested. </p>

    <h2>  Science (ACT only) </h2>
    <p> It’s a bit deceptive to call this the “Science” section, because it does not require any knowledge of science.  The primary skills that it tests are reading comprehension and data analysis.  The biggest challenge that students typically face in this section is not that the questions are too difficult, but rather that there is not enough time to answer them, as students are asked to answer 40 questions in 35 minutes.  For this reason, the science section is often the most overwhelming one for students when they first start preparing for the ACT, but scores can improve quickly as students become more familiar with the section, and learn efficient methods to answer the questions. </p>
