    <h1> Approach </h1>
    <p>  I typically spend about 20% of time in tutoring sessions teaching test content, and 80% of time teaching the test, but this does vary depending on the student.  This looks a little bit different for each section, but here is how it breaks down for each section. </p>
    <h2> Math </h2>
    <p> There are typically three reasons why a student will get a question wrong on the math section. The first reason is that the student may not have had the math knowledge to solve the problem.  This problem is solved by providing the student with problems on a specific topic, for example solving an equation for x, or finding the area of a circle.  This is an effective method of improving students scores because the SAT’s/ACT’s tests a very narrow set of topics over and over again, so a student can improve their scores by drilling these specific topics. </p>
    <p> The next reason that a student will typically get a question wrong is if they make a silly mistake.  The solution to this is not to just tell a student to “be careful” or to “check their work next time.”  The SAT/ACT are time pressured tests, which causes students to be more likely to make silly mistakes.  In addition, the creators of the tests intentionally word problems to confuse students, and cause them to make silly mistakes.  The test creators also make the answer choices such that if you make the silly mistakes that they expect you to make, you will come up with one of the wrong answer choices.  I help students solve the problems in the most efficient way possible, so they have a moment to check their answer immediately after to make sure they answered they did not make any silly mistakes. </p>
    <p> The final reason that students that will get a question wrong in the math section is that they did not understand what the question was asking.  For example, the question may be asking a student to solve a system of equations, but they may ask it in a weird way that the student has never seen before leaving them confused on what to do.  Although the way the problems worded is unique to the SAT/ACT, the test ask questions in the same way over and over again.  Therefore, I am able to teach students to decode SAT/ACT questions so they are able to understand what the question is asking. </p>
    <h2> Reading </h2>
    <p>  Reading comprehension is a skill that is developed over a students entire academic career, and it is not possible to significantly improve a student’s reading comprehension in only a few months.  Fortunately the SAT’s/ACT’s test a very specific type of reading comprehension, one which involves reading a passage very quickly and answering deceptive multiple choice questions.  I teach students a time efficient process to attack these passages and questions to increase their scores.  Specifically, I have students read the topic sentences of each paragraph the first time through, as opposed to the entire passage, and then have students cross out three wrong answers, as the wrong answers are much easier to identify than the correct answers.  </p>
    <h2> Writing </h2>
    <p> A lot of people wonder how the SAT’s/ACT’s tests a students writing ability on a multiple choice test, and the answer is that they don’t.  The writing section doesn’t test a student’s writing ability, but rather their knowledge of a handful of grammar rules.  Student’s are able to improve their scores faster in this section than the others by mastering the handful of writing rules tested.  </p>
