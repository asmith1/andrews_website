    <h1> Price Structure </h1>
    <p> A great way to save money on SAT/ACT prep without significantly compromising the benefit a student experiences from working with a tutor, is to work in a small group setting.  Below is how the price breaks down depending on the number of students in the session and the location of the session. </p>
    <p> Sessions that take place at my home are $40/hr, while sessions that take place at the student's house or at a central location are $60/hr. </p>
